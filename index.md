I am a PhD candidate at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests focus on developing computationally efficient statistical methods for large-scale genetic studies.

I led and participated various genetics related projects including  ancestry-agnostic model based contamination level estimation, haplotype phasing, trans-omics data analysis oriented rapid QC pipelines, sex-chromosome haplogroup analysis as well as other population genetics related methods.

More broadly, I also actively follow method development in single-cell sequencing analysis and deep learning applications in genetics.
